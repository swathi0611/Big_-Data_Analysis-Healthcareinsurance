# Big_-Data_Analysis-Healthcareinsurance
Healthcare companies face challenges in leveraging big data analysis to improve
revenue and gain deeper insights into customer behavior. These organizations aim to harness 
the power of the Big Data Ecosystem to analyze vast amounts of data collected from various 
sources, including web scraping and third-party data. However, the current problem lies in the 
lack of efficient methods to extract meaningful information from this extensive data pool and 
utilize it effectively. The healthcare industry requires an advanced analytics solution that can 
process and interpret the collected data to track customer behavior and conditions accurately. 
By doing so, insurance companies can tailor their insurance policy offers to individual needs 
and calculate royalties for prior policyholders more accurately. This data-driven approach is 
expected to enhance revenue generation and improve customer understanding, ultimately 
leading to better service provision
